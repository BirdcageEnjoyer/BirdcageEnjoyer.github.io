vernam cipher 
    * proven to be unbreakable
        - uses a one time pad as it's encryption key
        - one time key is generated in a truly random manner
            * this cannot be obtained from rng, because rng isn't truly random it is pseudorandom, things like weather phenomenon is used, half life decay
        - one time pad must be transferred by hand
    
    * decoding
        - encryption and decryption of the message is performed bit by bit using an excluse or (xor) operation with the shared key

        L = 01001100
        c = 01100011 - key, add these two binary numbers and you get
    
        00101111 = l

        exclusive or is a reversable operation, so with other logic gates like AND, you cant reverse it because you don't know what pair of binary numbers you need.
