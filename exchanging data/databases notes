        -
    * relational database 


entity relationships - the three entities are linked 
    * one to one
    * one to many
    * many to many

many to many
    * cannot be directly linked
    * e.g customer subscribes to product, product can be subscribed to many customers
        - cannot be linked directly because you would need several fields to hold the ID of each product a customer has subscribed to
        but you wont know how many products someone will decide to subscribe to
        - you also cannot duplicate the customer id
