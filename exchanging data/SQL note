-- SQL
--     * structured query language
--     * declarative language for querying and updating tables in a regional database
--     * can be used to create tables
--     * can be used in a programming language like python to access and manipulate a database

-- creating table:
-- e.g
--     CREATE TABLE tblProducts
--     (
--         prodID  CHAR(3) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
--         productName VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
--         subject VARCHAR(30),
--         level int
--         .....
--         ...
--     )


-- linked tables define
-- FOREIGN KEY (prodid) REFERENCES tblProducts(prodid)

-- to insert a new record into tblProducts table the syntax:
-- INSER INTO tblProducts(productid, name, subject, level, price).
-- VALUES (the values from above)

-- secondary key
--     * does not need to be uniue
--     * primary key is automatically indexed so any particular record can be found very quickly
--     * if searches often need to be made on title or subject either or both fields could be defined as a secondary key
--     * the field searched frequently will then be indexed for faster searches


-- when linking many to many:
--     * use composite key, because if you tried to for example, put a foreign key from the first entity, you wont have unique primary key anymore if 
--     they appear twice
--     e.g a customer buys monitor twice, the monitor of the same product id will appear twice and this causes data integrity issues etc since data
--     might become ambiguous and can no longer differentiate between records.

--     therefore
--             we could do this:
--                 customer -< order >- products
--                 where each order has a unique primary key because each order is a new order, and the secondary keys are the foreign keys, customer and product
--                 id, since secondary keys dont need to be unique. 
--                 customer id will link to customers table, product id will link to product table

-- alter is used to edit a column
--      * actions followed by alter:
--         * add entity data type
--         * drop column name
--         * modify column name data type, not null
-- * update statement is used to update a record in a database table
--     * update tablename
--     * set field name = field name + action, e.g salay*1.1
--     * where (only updates the certain records specified here)

-- * delete is used to delete from a record in table
--     * delete from tablename
--     * where ...

-- * referential integrity enforces that you cannot delete a record whiched is referenced already by a record in another table

-- * like opertaor enables us to filter on a substring and returns if substring is in the string.
--     * e.g, LIKE('comp%') percent is the wildcard, anything as long as it has 'comp' starting e.g 'computing' 'computer science'

-- * join table1name on table2name.key = table1name.key links 2 tables together
