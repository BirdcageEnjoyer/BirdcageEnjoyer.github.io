SQL
    * structured query language
    * declarative language for querying and updating tables in a regional database
    * can be used to create tables
    * can be used in a programming language like python to access and manipulate a database

creating table:
e.g
    CREATE TABLE tblProducts
    (
        prodID  CHAR(3) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        productName VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
        subject VARCHAR(30),
        level int
        .....
        ...
    )


linked tables define
FOREIGN KEY (prodid) REFERENCES tblProducts(prodid)

to insert a new record into tblProducts table the syntax:
INSER INTO tblProducts(productid, name, subject, level, price).
VALUES (the values from above)

secondary key
    * does not need to be uniue
    * primary key is automatically indexed so any particular record can be found very quickly
    * if searches often need to be made on title or subject either or both fields could be defined as a secondary key
    * the field searched frequently will then be indexed for faster searches
