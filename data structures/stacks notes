stacks overflow - pushing on to a full stack by adding more stuff when memory full
stack underflow - trying to pop from an empty stack since it has nothing in it


call stack used whenever a function or subroutine is called
memory location of a line of code is pushed onto a stack, so if you have a line of a function and then print, print is pushed on
then function is pushed on, the function gets run, then popped off the stack, and then print.

e.g 
max(a,b) - a function
print() 

max the function is run, then popped off stack, then print is run and popped off.

programming operations for stacks:
1. push(itemm) - adds item to the top of the stack (last spot)
2. pop() - removes last item in stack
3. isFull() - checks if stack is full - dont really need on a list in python since list is dynamic.
4. isEmpty() - checks if stack is empty
5. peek() - returns what value is at the top of the stack (last spot) without deleting it like pop() does
6. size() - returns number of items in the stack
