stacks overflow - pushing on to a full stack by adding more stuff when memory full
stack underflow - trying to pop from an empty stack since it has nothing in it


call stack used whenever a function or subroutine is called
memory location of a line of code is pushed onto a stack, so if you have a line of a function and then print, print is pushed on
then function is pushed on, the function gets run, then popped off the stack, and then print.

e.g 
max(a,b) - a function
print() 

max the function is run, then popped off stack, then print is run and popped off.
